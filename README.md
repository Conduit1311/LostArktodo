#Hello Guys :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

I am a junior developer in my first year :pinching_hand: . And I came up with the idea :bow:  to create a todo-app for Lost Ark.

Its major features are of course to check you dayli and weekly activities.
I styled the tabs like in the progress bar in the game, thats why 'Roster' is allways purple. And new created
characters are set to blue.

I will fix bugs and maybe update the theme in the future, but for now I just want to know what you guys think about it.
Of course please give some issue updates that you will encounter while using it.

#Features
- check your dayli and weekly activities
- automaticly resets your marks when the timer runs out
- you can save your characters with downloading a json file and import it later on
  so you dont have to type in your characters all over again!
- your weekly checks should also be still active after you come back later
  so you dont have to rememder which character did which activities days before
- icons that will help new players
- click on the icons or the title of the task and you will get a dialog with more info!
- some chips for quick info ( more are coming)


now please go to: :point_down::point_down::point_down:
